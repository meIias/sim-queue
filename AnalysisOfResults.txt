Analysis of Results:

After running the simulation for a continuous amount of steps, we retrieved
consistent numbers for both metrics. For the throughput, the values were
similar for both Number of hosts, 10 and 25. The throughput values were also
monotonically increasing, as we would expect. When the inter arrival rate is
increased, the time taken decreases and more packets are able to be pushed
through, which was consistent with our findings. The range of the throughput
seems to be around 7.xx -- 6xx.xx, which is also a reasonable set of numbers
given the fact that the rate was increasing from .01 packets/sec to the upper
.9 packets/sec. Now for the average packet delay, the numbers we got for N = 10
were close to each other, which is expected. The numbers for N = 25 are slightly
larger than the N=10 values, but that was also expected. With an increased
number of hosts there will be an increase, albeit small increase in packet
delay. Also, the packet delay values are very small .005xx -- .006xx, which is
also a reasonable result. We expect the avrage delay on a network to be very
small, otherwise it may take too long to receive packets, and that is not
correct.
